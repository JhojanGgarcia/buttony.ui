    "buttony": {
      "glass": "A translucent “glassmorphism” button featuring background blur (backdrop-blur-md) and semi-transparent white or black layers depending on the theme. Subtle borders and a soft shadow enhance its sense of depth. Ideal for modern and clean interfaces.",
      "minimalist": "A clean, visually simple button focused on clarity and elegance. It uses subtle borders and an inner shadow to add gentle depth without visual clutter. Perfect for sleek, understated user interfaces.",

    "ibelick": {
      "scaleIn": "A responsive button that slightly scales in (zooms in) when pressed. The active:scale-110 effect provides a quick, snappy interaction that enhances responsiveness without breaking layout flow.",
      "scaleOut": "A button that scales out (shrinks) on click, creating a quick “press-down” effect. The active:scale-95 transition adds depth to interactions while keeping a smooth and controlled feel.",
      "slideLeft": "A dual-layer text animation where the visible text slides out to the left while a duplicate slides in from the right. Produces a clean, fluid motion transition on hover.",

      "button3D": "A subtle 3D-style button that creates a raised appearance using a soft bottom shadow. On press, it flattens slightly to mimic a physical button click. Ideal for adding tactile feedback in minimalist UIs.",

      "hoverRing": "A minimal button that adds a ring and glow effect on hover using hover:ring and ring-offset. The soft outline animation enhances focus and accessibility without visual overload.",
      "expandCenter": "The inverse of ButtonCollapseCenter. The circular overlay expands from the center outward on hover, smoothly filling the background area. Adds a dynamic focal burst animation.",
      "collapseCenter": "A background animation button where a circular overlay collapses toward the center on hover. Creates a clean “closing” effect that emphasizes focus on the text. Perfect for minimal or glass-like UIs.",
      "expandLeft": "A left-to-right expanding animation button. A circular overlay slides in from the left, filling the button area as it scales up. Ideal for directional or interactive UI transitions.",
      "expandRight": "A right-to-left expanding animation button. The background overlay enters from the right and scales up, creating a smooth, mirrored effect of ButtonExpandLeft."

      "animatedBorder": "A bordered button featuring a subtle animated border loop. The motion path softly travels around the edges, enhancing the premium feel.",
      "rotateBorder": "A button with a rotating conic gradient border. Creates a futuristic spinning frame around the button’s content for dynamic interfaces.",

      "magnetic": "A magnetic/interactive button that slightly follows the cursor using a spring animation when enabled. Provides a subtle parallax-like motion that increases perceived responsiveness and attention."

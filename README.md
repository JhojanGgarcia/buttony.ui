## About

This page has been designed and redesigned with the purpose of showcasing the designs I've created, as well as those I'll continue developing in the future. It also features works from other talented developers.

I want to make it clear that I do not intend to claim ownership or authorship of any designs that are not mine — all rights belong to their respective creators. On this page, you'll also find links to visit their official profiles or websites.

I'd like to give special mention to ibelick and guhrodrrigues, two creators I deeply admire for what they've accomplished. This project is, in a way, a small tribute to their amazing work.

I hope you enjoy this new version of Buttony as much as I enjoyed creating it.
